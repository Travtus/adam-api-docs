title: "Customers Requiring Attention"
---

## **Overview**

On this tab within a community, you can see a list of customers which your data indicates require attention. Clicking on any customer tile will **expand to show a summary of their recent experience**; clicking Read More will take you to the summary page of the customer so that you can understand more about their experience.

If there are no customers requiring attention, you will see a message saying as such.

## **How the list is determined**

This list contains customers who were identified as **high priority** (those whose customer experience score is in the lowest 20% across your whole portfolio) **within the time period** you've selected (week or month).

The list is regenerated on a weekly basis so if a customer moves from high priority to mid during the course of a week, then they would move out of the list the following week.

See [<u>here</u>](https://intercom.help/travtus-d83752c4176c/en/articles/9172821-customer-experience-scoring) for more information on our customer experience scoring approach.

## **Newsfeed Alerts**

The **alerts** in the newsfeed will also highlight residents requiring attention but they are **focused on recent contact **so you may see a **smaller number** here than in the overall list.

For example if the alert says "3 residents at Community1 are having a bad experience", this is just referring to the 3 people to contact **most recently**; clicking the alert will take you to the Residents Requiring Attention page for Community1 and you will see a message telling you that the list is **filtered by the 3 people relating to the alert**. Clicking the 'x' will remove the filter and allow you to see the whole list.
