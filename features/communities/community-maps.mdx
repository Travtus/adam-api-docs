Coming Soon: Maps will also support automated leasing conversations by presenting available units to prospective residents.

For example, if someone is searching for a three-bedroom unit, our AI agent can now share real time availability alongside an interactive floor plan. This creates a more informed and engaging experience for prospective renters.
