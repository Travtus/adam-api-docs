title: "Community Action Plan"

## **How to get there**

To see **suggestions of ways you could improve the experience** within a community, you can navigate to any community page and **click on the check box icon**.

**To get to a community page**, you can click on its name from the **Newsfeed** area, or by selecting **Communities** from the menu in the top right then selecting a specific community from the list.

We establish the suggestions by summarizing issues, complaints, risks, and other themes across this specific community and use this to drive the top 5 ideas to address these themes.

## **How to interpret**

- Action plans are re-generated on a daily basis and cover the period selected in the date filter at the top.
- We restrict the list to focus on **high priority events** so you may not see suggestions relating to things that are lower priority than some others.
- We try to limit the suggestions to a manageable amount but there may be more to do here - you can derive your own recommendations by reviewing the **Summary**, **Customers Requiring Attention** and **Top Resident Goals** pages.
- Do what's right for your community! We base these suggestions on what we see in your data but there will obviously be things outside of this going on as well, so **combine our action plans with what you already know** about the community for a recipe for success.
- You may want to also consider more **holistic solutions to a problem** - if there's a theme of issues across multiple communities, it could be that it's better to roll out a companywide solution. The best way to find out if this is the case is simply to **use search**, e.g. "are we seeing issues with \<topic\> across multiple communities?"
- Clicking on any of the numbers in circles (citations) will open a list of the reports relating to the issue.
