## **How to get there**

## **How to interpret**

Underneath the community name, you'll see the current [****<u><u><u>community score and rating</u></u></u>****](https://docs2.travtus.com/features/communities/community-scoring-and-trending), and, if applicable, the **review score** (this is an aggregation of all historic review data we have for this community).

The first page you'll see when clicking on a community breaks down the data related to that community into:

- **Reviews**: a summary of any reviews customers have left for the community [Note this is only available if you are sending this data source. Please [<u>get in touch</u>](mailto:support@travtus.com) if you'd like to discuss how to do this].
- **Complaints**: anything our models identify in your data as a complaint
- **Risks**: anything our models identify as physical or safety risks to the community
- **Escalations**: a need to escalate can be due to the seriousness of the issue, risk or customer frustration
- **Summary**: an overview of the themes in the community

Use this page and the community score as a way of **quickly getting up to speed with what's been going on in the community**.

ðŸ’¡**Tip**: Note that the data on this page will show data relating to either the last 30 days or the last 7 days, depending on what time filter you have selected.

Clicking the **Share** button at the bottom will offer you two options:

- **Copy**: this copies the text to your clipboard so that you can paste into your chosen form of communication: this can be useful if you want to send it in an instant messenger or use it as part of a report.
- **Email**: this will open your chosen mail provider with the text already contained in the body of the email. Use this if you just want to quickly share the information with a colleague.
