title: "Industry Benchmarking"
---

We've introduced the ability to see not only how a community is comparing to your company average but also the industry average, allowing you to benchmark against others and gain an understanding of what your peers are doing.

## **How does industry benchmarking scoring work?**

The**Industry Benchmark Score**  is calculated by examining communications across all our customers; we crunch through over 50,000 messages per week to establish an industry average performance for a community. This score focuses on:

- Volume and nature of **complaints**
- Number of **escalations** (due to unresolved issues or matters of high urgency)
- Issues causing **property risk**
- Frequency and severity of **customer concerns**
- Challenges in the **collections** process
- Volume of **support requests** (including repeat requests)
- Problems stemming from the **technology** being used

We aggregate the score across all customers **on a weekly basis.**

## **Where can I see it?**

On the chart on the Trending page of a community card, you will see:

- a **solid** line showing you how the **score of this specific community** has changed over the last period (selected in your date filter in the top right of the page);
- a **dashed **line showing you the **average** community score for the **company** over that period;
- a **dotted** line showing you the **average **community score for the **industry** over that period.
