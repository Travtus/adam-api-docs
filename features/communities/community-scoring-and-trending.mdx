title: "Community Scoring and Trending"
---

The score of a community and its current trend can be seen underneath the community name, and on the **Trending **page within a community page, you'll see a visual display of how it has changed over time and how it compares to the rest of the communities in your portfolio.

As well as the score, underneath the community name, you'll also see, if applicable, the **review score** (this is an aggregation of all historic review data we have for this community). If you're not yet sending your reviews data but would like to explore options, drop us a line at [<u>support@travtus.com</u>](mailto:support@travtus.com).

**Overview**

Communities are evaluated on a **scale of 0-100 **and **ranked within your portfolio**. Each community’s performance is **normalized based on their size **for comparative analysis within your portfolio.

On the chart on the Trending page of a community card, you will see:

- a solid line showing you how the **score of this specific community** has changed over the last period (selected in your date filter in the top right of the page);
- a dashed line showing you the **average community score** for the **company** over that period;
- a dotted line showing you the **average community score** for the **industry** over that period;
- coloured bands corresponding to the grades (see below for more information;
- at the bottom of the page you'll find a written summary of what the chart is showing.

**How do I interpret the chart and the scoring?**

- The coloured bands correspond to ranges between 0 and 100, and can be categorised as seen below:

- If a community's line is continually below the company average, you may want to investigate this further - sometimes we see a community scoring above and below over time but consistently below is usually a cause for concern.
- Each community is ranked relative to the communities in the rest of your portfolio; this is to help you focus on your specific areas for improvement, regardless of what's happening in the wider industry. However, you can also see how your company average and this community's score compares to the rest of the industry using the dotted line.
- Using the chart above, we can see that this community is performing worse than the company average but is still in a better position than the wider industry.

## **Ranking Example**

If you have 3 communities in your portfolio; let's call them Spring Parks, Summer Gardens and Autumn Ridge. In week 1, your leaderboard might look like the below.

| **Week 1**     | **Score** | **Rating** | **Position** | **Trend** |
| :------------- | :-------- | :--------- | :----------- | :-------- |
| Spring Parks   | 13        | B          | 2            | -         |
| Summer Gardens | 9         | C          | 3            | -         |
| Autumn Ridge   | 67        | A          | 1            | -         |

The next week, there's a mice infestation at Spring Parks so its score drops to 8. Nothing much happens at the others so their scores remain unchanged. This means that Summer Gardens moves from position 3 into position 2 due to its marginally higher score, and thus its trend (relative to the other communities) is upwards.

So our leaderboard looks like the below (changes highlighted in yellow):

| **Week 2**     | **Score** | **Rating** | **Position** | **Trend** |
| :------------- | :-------- | :--------- | :----------- | :-------- |
| Spring Parks   | 8         | C          | 3            | Down      |
| Summer Gardens | 9         | C          | 2            | Up        |
| Autumn Ridge   | 67        | A          | 1            | No change |
