Grouping your communities into the groups you use internally, such as their region or collection, allows you to more easily review and interact with your data.

**ðŸ’¡ Tip**: If you do not see groups in your My Communities area or within a goal then it might be that you don't have access to specific groups or that your organization doesn't yet have any groups set up. [<u>Contact us</u>](mailto:support@travtus.com) if you need support for this.

## **Groups in the My Communities page**

Here you'll see the communities organized into their groups as shown below. When you first navigate to the list, the groups will be collapsed; clicking a group title expands the list.

## **Filtering by groups**

On the Customers list, and the [**<u>Messages</u>**](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9173000-exploring-your-data-volumes) and [**<u>Goals</u>**](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9220756-exploring-your-data-content) screens, you'll see your communities organized into their groups as shown below. Selecting a whole group will filter the data on the page by data associated with those communities.

This allows you to understand more easily the patterns in the data within specific groups - for example, identifying whether customer (or staffing) needs vary from region to region.

**ðŸ’¡Note that a community can belong to more than one group.**
