## **Automated task creation**

A task is created when you have the **Respond** feature turned on. Click [<u>here</u>](https://docs2.travtus.com/getting-started-with-travtus/how-does-it-work) to read more about how it works. In the list of tasks, you will see:

- The task, due date and community of each
- The ability to **filter** by community and assignee
- Completed tasks at the bottom

## **Creating a task yourself**

It's also possible to create a task for yourself. If you navigate to **Menu \> Tasks**, you will see a section at the bottom where you can add your own task - simply type into the box and select a community. Once you've created the task, you can also add the following detail:

- Description
- Assignee
- Category (e.g. leasing, maintenance)
- Due date
- Priority
