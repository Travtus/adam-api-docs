title: "How to use Explore"
---

Our Explore feature allows users to use **natural language to ask questions of their data**. You can ask anything in the way you might of an associate - things like "what's frustrating residents the most at the moment?" and "where is pest control a problem?". Explore will tell you the information you need to know. You can also narrow your search by date range to ensure only relevant search results are returned.

Explore also **works for specific communities or customers** - you'll see the search box change whenever you are on a community or customer page - this can help narrow down your search if you already know some of the context of what you're searching for. If you _don't _want to search within that community or customer, simply click the "x" next to the name.

## **ðŸ’¡ Tips for getting the most out of search**

- Use questions like "**where**", "**what**" and "**when**"
- Use the **date range** filter
- Once you've established a theme, **drill down further** - for example if you've asked about _what_ the main issues are, you can follow up by asking _where _the issues occur most, etc
- If you identify a community or customer you want to know more about, use the menu in the top right to navigate to **My Communities **or **My Customers**, and find them there (we're working on the ability to click links directly from search)

You can also use search to **find specific entities**, including:

- **Customers**: if you know the customer you want to navigate to, you can type their name in and you'll see a dropdown appear - simply click on their name and you'll get taken to an overview about them
- **Communities**: similarly, if you know the community you want to navigate to, follow the steps above using the community name
- **Goals**: if you want to look at how a customer goal is trending over time, such as "I want to give notice to vacate" or "I'm having technical issues", you can type part of the phrase and select it from the dropdown that appears.
