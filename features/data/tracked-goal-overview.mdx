## **How to get there**

By clicking on a user goal (such as "I Want To Create A Maintenance Task") anywhere in the Gateway, you can reach a page showing you **how that goal has trended over time** and allowing you to filter to **drill down further**.

Places that you can access these goals include:

- Insights \> Tracked Goal (if you've already selected a goal to track)
- Insights \> Top Customer Goal
- Community \> Top Resident Goals
- Latest News \> any item that's Trending

## **How to interpret**

This chart shows you **how something a customer wants to achieve** (e.g. disputing a charge, giving notice to vacate, creating a maintenance task, etc) **has** **trended over time**. You can use the information to inform areas for improvement or general focus and actions for your teams - for example, if there is an upwards trend in needing technical support, this might point towards a more global issue with your customer-facing tech systems.

Don't forget,**you can always ask search if you want to find out more**  - try "are we having companywide issues with tech" or "which systems are people complaining about the most".

On the page, you'll see:

- a **count** of occurrences over the period
- a **trend** comparing the count to that of the **previous period**
- a chart with a **trend over time** showing how the goal has trended vs the baseline: this is based on the **volume of occurrences of that goal**, i.e. how many reports of it we have seen from your customers, versus the median volume of occurrences of that goal over the past 90 days
- a **summary** describing what the chart is showing and giving a view of the lower level customer conversations and a list of communities where we've seen this goal be reported the most (or if you are looking at a goal within a specific community, you will simply see this community's name above the goal title in the top left)

You can filter the chart by community, granularity (e.g. by day/week/month) and channel.
