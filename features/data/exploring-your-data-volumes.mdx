title: "Exploring Your Data: Volumes"
---

# **How to get there**

There are two different ways to see aggregated views of your data. By clicking on **Insights** (found in the top right menu) **\>Messages** on the home page, you can see information about **volumes of data** such as a breakdown of the messages by channel (e.g. email vs SMS), source (e.g. customer vs vendor) and also how the volume has changed over time.

If you are interested in seeing the **content of the data** and themes within this (such as top resident goals), you can use the menu in the top right and navigate to **Insights \> Top Customer Goal**. Check out [<u>this article</u>](https://docs2.travtus.com/features/data/exploring-your-data-content) for more information.

These screens enable you to delve down and slice and dice the data as you wish.

# **How to interpret**

There are 3 different views of your data you can get here. You can **adjust the time window** for all charts using the date filter at the top of the list selecting between last 7 days, last 30 days, or a custom date range.

## **Source**

**Use this view to understand where most of your messages are coming from**, for example customer vs vendor (and you can filter by channel to look at just email or SMS for example).

High volumes of communication from each source can be indicative of different things - and it can also help to identify other areas where Travtus can help.

For example, if you are seeing a high proportion of incoming messages coming from brokers, you might be interested in our **deals pipeline** which helps to ****translate the unstructured data about new opportunities into an easily digestible array of information, allowing you toidentify the opportunities most of interest**** .

## **Time**

**Use this view to understand how volumes have varied over time**.

If you are seeing an overall trend upwards, this could be indicative of a number of things -

- potentially an increase in interest from prospects,
- or an increase in those giving notice to vacate,
- or an increase in maintenance requests,
- or many others.

Each of these causes would obviously have their own solutions, and **that's where the filters come in!**

There are a number of filters available to help you get the most out of the chart:

- **Community**: Use this if you're interested in how volumes are varying across specific communities - or if you want to compare multiple communities, you can overlay them.
- **Granularity**: This helps with the display of the chart - if you are seeing a lot of spikes and troughs (e.g. because communication drops off at weekends), you can use this to "**smooth out**" the chart's appearance by selecting bigger periods of time.
- **Channel**: As above, use this to differentiate between email, SMS, voice transcripts, etc. You might want to do this if you want to see patterns across communities which only have certain channels in use.
- **Topic**: This is a great filter for **understanding the specific cause of an increase or decrease in volumes** - especially if you already have a hunch. You can filter by things like "Apartment Search" or "Dog Park". If you're not sure where to start, just use search to ask "what topics are increasing/decreasing the most over the last week?" for example.
- **Actionable**: Use this to distinguish between messages which were more of a **Q&A**, e.g. "what's the pet policy?" or "how do I collect a parcel?", versus those which are **require action**, such as "I want to add a new tenant to my lease" or "I want to report a leak". \
  A large proportion of Q&A is an indicator that you may wish to turn on the "Respond" feature, to allow our [<u>digital teammate, Adam</u>](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9174358-who-is-adam), to respond on your behalf.
- **Queue**: Use this to **look at how specific departments' work load might be changing** over time, for example you could filter by just "Leasing" or "Onboarding and see if there's an increased volume coming into these teams.

## **Channel**

**Use this view to understand the split of different channels of communication**. You can also filter by the role (i.e. customer, vendor, etc) and by community.

A high proportion of one particular channel gives you **an idea of the behavior** of customers within your portfolio and within individual communities. Knowing this can help you **adjust your communication strategy to suit their needs**.

## **Queue**

**Use this view to understand which teams have the biggest workload**. This can help with staffing planning. You can also filter by the channel and whether or not the requests were questions vs tasks.

### **Example Use Case: Understanding staffing needs**

In the below image, there is clearly an influx of onboarding needs - you might want more people working through this queue than others, because it has a higher volume than leasing and retention for example. This way you are training your people on specific things and not everything, and you can send your customers to pre-established criteria for faster resolution.
