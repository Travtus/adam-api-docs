# **How to get there**

There are two different ways to see aggregated views of your data.

By clicking the menu in the top right and navigating to **Insights \> Top Customer Goal**, you can see the **content of the data **and themes within this (such as top resident goals).

If you are interested in information about **volumes of data**, such as a breakdown of by channel or trend over time, click on **Insights \>Messages** from the top right menu. Check out [<u>this article</u>](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9173000-exploring-your-data-volumes) for more information.

These screens enable you to delve down and slice and dice the data as you wish.

# **How to interpret**

All data can be filtered by:

- community
- date range (using the 1W, 1M, 3M, 1Y options near the top)
- channel

## **Top User Goals**

Here you will see a list of the top goals of your users, and for each one:

- the percentage of your messages which that goal takes up (during the time period)
- a trend line (relative to the previous time period)
- a pin button to allow you to [<u>track this goal</u>](https://intercom.help/travtus-d83752c4176c/en/articles/9172998-tracking-goals) (you'll see it appear in Insights)

Some ways to get the most value out of this list:

- Be aware that the highest proportion is usually still lower than (or around) 10%: we see a **huge variety of topics **across all our customers' data and it's important to acknowledge this range. It requires a large amount of knowledge of processes and systems in order to effectively deal with all of these. This is something that our [<u>digital teammate Adam</u>](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9174358-who-is-adam) can help with, by understanding a wealth of company- and community-specific information and using that to be the first point of contact in [<u>responding to your customers</u>](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9172791-how-does-it-work#h_2630ea84b1).
- You can use this list to **inform a variety of business priorities**, such as:
  - **staffing**: if there are a high proportion of goals around leasing or maintenance then this may indicate teams that requires more support/resource
  - **addressing problems holistically**: for example, a high proportion of maintenance tasks could indicate issues with general wear and tear of appliances or buildings and might need exploring further. You can use search to delve deeper into this.
  - if you are focused on one or more specific communities, it may be interesting to see how the **top goals change between different regions**, and this could lead to more region-specific strategies.
- Clicking on one of the goals takes you to a screen with a chart showing **how this goal has trended over time **- this allows you to get a sense of whether a top position goal is only recently important to your customers or whether it's consistently high.
- Using the pin for **goals that are important to you **means you can easily access them going forwards.

## **Top Topics**

This list is an aggregated version of the previous list - if you wish to look at the **goals grouped into their specific topics**, this tab is for you. It can help you get a better idea of themes due to the higher level nature of the information.

Clicking the arrow on the right will **expand the topic **to allow you to see the **underlying goals **that have been grouped into the topic, as well as the counts of messages. As mentioned above, clicking the pin will allow you to track the goal in your My Pins area, and clicking on the goal itself will show you how the goal has trended over time.

You can use the same techniques as mentioned above to get value from and interpret the list.
