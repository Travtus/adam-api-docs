## **How to get there**

To get a view of some suggested steps to take with a particular customer, you can navigate to a **customer page** and **click on the check box icon**.

To get to a customer page, you can click on their name from the **Latest News** area, or by selecting **Customers** from the menu in the top right then selecting a specific customer from the list and clicking **Read More**.

## **How to interpret**

This page provides you with a **series of steps you could take to improve this customer's experience**. You can use the Share button at the bottom to either copy the text or open your mail provider and email it.

- We restrict the list to focus on **recent and high priority events** so you may not see suggestions relating to things that are lower priority.
- We try to limit the suggestions to a manageable amount but there may be more to do here - you can derive your own recommendations by reviewing the **Summary** and **Conversation History** pages.
- Do what's right for your customer! We base these suggestions on what we see in your data but there will obviously be things outside of this going on as well, so **combine our action plans with what you already know** about the customer for a recipe for success.
- You may want to also consider more **holistic solutions to a problem** - if there's a theme of issues across multiple customers, it could be that it's better to roll out a companywide solution. The best way to find out if this is the case is simply to **use search**, e.g. "are we seeing issues with \<topic\> across multiple customers?"
