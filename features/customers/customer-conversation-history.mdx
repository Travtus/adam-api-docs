## **How to get there**

To get a view of the data informing the scores and summaries of a customer, it's possible to see the history of their conversations: you can do this by navigating to a **customer page **and **clicking on the pencil icon**.

To get to a customer page, you can click on their name from the **Latest News** area, or by selecting **Customers** from the menu in the top right then selecting a specific customer from the list and clicking **Read More**.

## **How to interpret**

This page provides you with the history of interactions with the customer. From most to least recent, you'll see summaries of the inbound interactions from that customer. This area can be useful to get a feel for all the times the customer has made contact and what their full historic experience has been.
