## **How to get there**

To get a summary of a customer's recent experience and see what email address we are associating with them, you can navigate to a **customer page **and **click on the exclamation mark icon** (and this is the default tab you will land on when navigating to a customer page).

To get to a customer page, you can click on their name from the **Latest News** area, or by selecting **Customers** from the menu in the top right then selecting a specific customer from the list and clicking **Read More**.

## **How to interpret**

- This page provides you with an overview of the customer's total experience, and a list of key concerns. You can use it to quickly see **what recent issues the customer has had**.
- We identify people using a variety of identifiers including email address, telephone number (if provided in the data) and name; it's sometimes useful to see which **email address **the customer name is related to in the data
