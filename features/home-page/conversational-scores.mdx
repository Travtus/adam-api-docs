## **What are Conversational Scores?**

Conversational Scores are your smart assistant for understanding how conversations with tenants or prospective renters are going. It uses AI to review each interaction and assigns a **conversational score** to help your team:

- Respond better and faster
- Improve the customer experience
- Boost your leasing performance

Whether it’s a support request or a leasing inquiry, Conversational Scores gives you a clear, easy-to-read breakdown of how well the interaction went and where there’s room to improve.

## **How are Conversations Scored?**

Every time a conversation is updated, Conversational Scores automatically processes it through our AI-powered platform. The system looks at **what was said**, **how it was said**, and **what happened as a result**. These insights are then rolled up into a score you can track over time.

You don’t need to do anything as the score appears directly in Conversational Scores.

## **What do the Scores Measure?**

Conversational Scores score conversations in three key areas:

1. **Issue Resolution**

   We look at whether the customer’s issue was resolved clearly and efficiently. Positive indicators include:
   - The customer’s request was fully resolved
   - Clear next steps were provided
   - The customer expressed satisfaction
   - There were no signs of frustration or confusion
2. **Agent Behavior**

   This section scores how the agent handled the conversation. The AI looks for:
   - Active listening and empathy
   - Clear, respectful, and jargon-free communication
   - Whether the agent confirmed understanding and followed up appropriately

   Bonus points are awarded for personal touches like using the customer’s name, confirming contact details, or summarizing the issue clearly.
3. **Leasing Performance (for leasing-related conversations)**

   For leasing calls or chats, we also score how well the agent guided the prospect toward a tour or booking. Points are given for:
   - Highlighting apartment features and amenities
   - Providing pricing and tour options
   - Using persuasive language to create excitement
   - Confirming or scheduling a tour

## **How the Score Is Calculated**

Each conversation earns a **Total Score out of 100**, based on how many relevant behaviors and outcomes were achieved.

The formula is:

**TotalScore = (Points Earned ÷ Points Available) × 100**

**Points Available by Conversation Type**

To ensure fairness, the maximum possible points depend on the type of conversation:

- **Leasing (non-call):** Max possible points = 136
- **Leasing (call):** Max possible points = 116
- **Non-Leasing (non-call):** Max possible points = 93
- **Non-Leasing (call):** Max possible points = 73

This means leasing calls are judged only on leasing criteria, and non-leasing conversations are scored using the relevant standards.

## **Why This Matters**

The Conversational Score is more than a number — it’s a lens into how your team is performing in real interactions. Over time, this helps you:

- Spot training opportunities
- Understand what’s working well
- Drive better outcomes for both tenants and your business

And most importantly, it helps you **put your best voice forward** — every time.
