**What metrics are measured to provide the conversation score?**

The conversation score evaluates customer-agent interactions across four key areas:

- agent performance, including personalized service, clear communication, and proactive support.
- customer experience, measuring ease of interaction, satisfaction, and frustration.
- operational efficiency, tracking response times, conversation duration, and interaction complexity.
