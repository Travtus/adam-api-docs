Using the Studio you can now easily manage user/community uploads and user permissions in bulk or on an individual level.\*

## Creating Roles

In the Studio you can create roles which will allow you to assign users the appropriate access and permissions when adding them to the platform.

1. Load up the Studio
2. Under “Users” select “Roles” tab at the top and click **\+ Add Role**
3. Enter the Role Name, a brief description

At this point you can also assign users to this role designation or create role and do this later.

## Adding individual Users
