Welcome to the documentation for the Travtus API & Webhook platform — your go-to resource for building integrations, automations and data flows across property-management systems.

Here’s a quick overview of what you’ll find:

- **Getting Started & Access** – Learn how to request API credentials, review the licensing terms, and authenticate your client.
- **API Endpoints** – Access core data types like Communities, Persons, Leases, Units and more. Each endpoint is clearly documented with HTTP methods, required fields and examples.
- **Webhook Support** – Get real-time notifications of events via webhooks; set up endpoints, verify signatures and manage retries.
- **Bulk Feeds & Deployment** – For high-volume data needs, access file uploads, feed exports and deployment-guide content.

Whether you’re building a one-off integration or a full data-pipeline, this documentation will guide you through authentication, data modelling, event handling and best practices.
