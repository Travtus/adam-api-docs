title: "Re-enabling Chrome Extension"
description: "Occasionally, your Chrome browser might automatically disable extensions. This can happen after a browser update or if an extension hasn't been used for a while. If you find the Travtus Chrome extension isn't working as expected, it might simply be disabled."

**To quickly check and re-enable it, follow these simple steps:**

1. Open Chrome
2. Click on **Extensions** \> **Manage Extensions**
3. Find your Travtus Gateway and ensure the toggle is **switched on**
