## **Community by community approach**

If you want to systematically go through your communities, weâ€™d suggest the following steps as a starting point.

1. Navigate to **Communities** using the menu in the top right
2. Ensure the list is **sorted by Rating - Ascending**. At the top of the list you'll now see the lowest scoring communities so it gives you an idea of those which need attention
3. Click Read More then familiarize yourself with the **Summary **and **Action Plan **to understand the situation and suggested next steps at this community
4. If you spot a particular issue and want to **check whether it is widespread**, **use search**: "is \<describe issue\> happening in multiple communities?"
5. Check the **Trending **tab to see whether the community is above or below your **company's average **and the **industry average**. This can inform your priorities to help you focus on those below the company average.
6. The **Resident Goals **tab gives you an insight into **what's important to customers **at each community - and can vary a lot from community to community so it's worth delving deeper into this.

## **Urgency focus**

If you want to ensure you're keeping on top of the most recent issues, you can use the newsfeed.

1. Start at **Latest News **(this is the page you will have landed on)
2. Use the **Category filter **to switch off Kudos, Trending and Information so that you are left only with Alerts
3. **Select the top alert **to read about the most recent complaints in that community - note that you'll also see other recent complaints and Kudos when you do this
4. If you want to delve more into that community, select the arrow next to its name then follow step 3 above onwards
5. If you don't need to delve further, go back to the Latest News and move on to the next alert

## **Site visit**

Ahead of a site visit, you probably want to quickly familiarize yourself with what's going on at the community you're visiting. To navigate to the community you can search for it or navigate to the Communities list and find it there. Once on the specific community card, we'd suggest:

1. Familiarize yourself with the **Summary** to get a quick overview of the situation at this community (use the date filter (calendar icon top right) to **filter by Last Week/Month **to ensure you're getting recent information)
2. Check the **Trending** tab to see its recent pattern and also how it compares to the rest of the company and the industry
3. Check the **Customers Requiring Attention **tab to familiarize yourself with any specific individuals and their issues
4. The **Resident Goals **tab gives you an insight into **what's important to customers **at this community; it can alert you as to big current focus areas such as maintenance (indicating possible widespread fixes required) or vacate notices (indicating overall dissatisfaction of residents), etc
5. Finish with the **Action Plan **where you'll see suggested immediate steps that could be taken at this community
6. **Search** "what are residents asking for most at \<community name\>?" to understand things that might improve their experience, e.g. Is there a particular service or amenity being asked for repeatedly that could improve or delight

# **Validating success**

If you take actions off the back of the information you've gleaned, what's the best way to track whether they've had an effect? Depending on the action, there are a number of ways to achieve this in the Gateway. Generally speaking, **pinning **anything will always help you keep an eye on it, so whether it's a customer, community or goal, this would be a good place to start.

Here are some specific scenarios:

- If you were tracking whether a **community's performance **has improved, use the community scoring and trending. Pin the community so that you can easily access it and look out for an upward trend. Note that communities are rescored on a weekly basis. Check out [<u>this article</u>](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9178113-community-scoring-and-trending) if you want to learn more about community scoring.
- If it were a specific customer you were monitoring then the same approach applies - **pin the customer** so you can keep an eye on them and check their scoring for an improvement.
- You can also **pin goals within one community or across all**. And from the tile you can see the trend immediately.
  - If you originate in a community's list of Resident Goals, you can pin from here and that will enable you to keep an eye on, say, "I want to report a technical issue" within that specific community
  - If you want to look at goals across all communities, you can do this from **Insights** (accessed via the hamburger menu), then click Top Customer Goal
