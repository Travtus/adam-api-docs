A good starting point for answering this question is to **use search** to ask the question directly "what do customers care most about right now?". Let's say the response highlights the following themes:

- Updates and Information Requests
- Immediate or Urgent Responses
- Pricing and Lease Terms

Your next steps could be to delve further into each one - perhaps asking where this is coming up most or getting specifics on the types of updates or responses.

Another good place to start is the Top Goals -

1. Navigate to **Insights** (accessed via the menu in the top right) \>**Top Customer Goal**
2. Here you will see a list of the ****top 50 things thatcustomers are contacting about**** ; this can help inform things like new initiatives in the services offered to your customers, or product features in the resident portal.

For example, if submitting insurance details is happening a lot then it makes sense to ensure this process is as seamless as possible within the resident portal or app - perhaps focusing on automating it altogether. You can also use search to ask "what are people saying about submitting their insurance details?"
