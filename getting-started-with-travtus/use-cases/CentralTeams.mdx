# **Problem Statement**

**_"I want to know what an_** **_individual customerâ€™s journey has been."_**

# **Gateway User Journey**

Having had a **customer escalation**, it would be helpful to know exactly what they've been communicating about. To reach this information, start with the following steps.

1. Navigate to the customer either by searching for their name or going to **Customers **from the menu in the top right
2. Select the final tab (with the **pencil icon**) to see their **Conversation History**
3. Here you will see **everything they have contacted about**, starting with the most recent message. This can be helpful to understand what their experience has been. Combined with the scoring and action plan, you should be able to get a good overview of the individual.

# **Problem Statement**

**_"I need information about a specific community."_**

# **Gateway User Journey**

If an applicant is asking community-specific questions and you wanted to deal with the query rather than having to refer the customer to the onsite team, it's worth knowing that you can **access knowledge** about the community by **using search**. Try:

- "What's the parking policy at \<community name\>?"
- "Are pets allowed at \<community name\>?"
- "Do we offer any early payment rewards at \<community name\>?"
