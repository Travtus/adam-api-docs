## **General demand overview**

If you want to get a general overview of the types of work coming your teams' way, the below could be a good place to start.

1. Navigate to **Insights** (via menu in top right) \> **Messages**
2. Select the **Queue** tab
3. Here you will find a breakdown of the different themes your customers have been contacting about. You can use this to get an understanding of the areas of highest demand in terms of both resource and knowledge (internal processes, etc)

**Advanced**:

- Use the \*\*Actionable filter \*\*to determine the split of messages which were required a follow-up action (e.g. sorting out a maintenance issue) versus those which didn't (e.g. a question on the parking policy). This can help you determine the type of resource needed in each area.
- Combine the information with the **Time tab** - **filter that by queue** for deeper investigation into each area - e.g. if Onboarding is the most common topic, is it increasing or has it remained at a steady volume for a while?

## **Specific community request**

If you're trying to understand the demand in a particular community, we'd suggest the following as a good starting point.

1. Navigate to**Communities**  (via the menu in the top right) and find the community you need
2. Click **Read More**
3. Check the community **score** and **trend** at the top and the \*\*Trending \*\*tab:
   - Is the community performance improving?
   - Is it above average for the company/industry?
4. Check the **Summary**, **Action Plan** and **Top Resident Goals**:
   - What complaints, risks or escalations are residents reporting?
   - Do they map to the resource request? E.g. if the request is for an additional head in leasing, how high is this in the list of goals and are people complaining about the service in this area?

## **Suggested searches**

- "In which communities is there the highest demand for \<theme\>?"
- "What are people complaining about most in \<community name\>?"
- "How can I make customers happier?"
