## **Problem Statement:**

## **_"I want to be able to solve customer problems holistically instead of single-purpose solutions."_**

## **<u>Gateway User Journeys</u>**

## Whenever you spot or hear about a problem a customer is having, **use Explore** to find out whether the problem is happening more widely.

1. Say someone is complaining about noise outside their apartment, search "**are customers having issues with noise**"
2. If it appears it's more widespread than just the one report you've heard of, search "**tell me the names** of customers having issues with noise"
3. You can then delve into a couple of the people by typing their name into search or by going to **Customers** (accessed via the menu in the top right) and searching for them there
4. On the **Summary** page (the first tab you land on), you'll see more detail about their experience

If you do take action to address the noise issue, and want **validate whether it has made a difference** you can use the Tracked Goal "I Want To Make A Noise Complaint".

Type into search "noise complaint" and wait for the dropdown to appear - from here you'll be able to select the goal and then you can pin it to keep an eye on it in **Insights** (accessed via the menu in the top right).

## **Problem Statement:**

## **_"I want to know an individual customer's overall journey"_**

Just before you're about to speak to a customer, it would be great to **know all the topics they've been contacting about**, even if they're only coming in to discuss one. To reach this information, start with the following steps.

1. Navigate to the customer either by searching for their name or going to Customers from the hamburger menu in the top right
2. Select the final tab (with the **pencil icon**) to see their **Conversation History**
3. Here you will see **everything they have contacted about**, starting with the most recent message. This can be helpful to understand what their experience has been.
4. For example, if you can see one of the things they contacted about was adding their partner to the lease, you can greet them as they walk in "Hey, how's your partner settling in?" to give them confidence you know who they are and make them feel special.

## **Problem Statement:**

## **_"I'm a new joiner and I want to know how best to help our customers."_**

## **<u>Gateway User Journeys</u>**

The Gateway stores knowledge about your community based on documents like resident welcome guides, the website and also historic responses to customer queries. If you don't know the answer to a question a customer is asking, you can \*\*use search \*\*to find out how things are done round here.

For example if a resident walks into the office and wants to know where the parking is and how they get a permit, you can ask "where is the parking" followed by "how do we assign new parking permits".
