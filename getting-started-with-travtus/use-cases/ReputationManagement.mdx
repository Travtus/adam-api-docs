## **Problem statements:**

## **_"I want to proactively manage our brand's reputation."_**

## **_"I want to maximise customer satisfaction across all communities."_**

## **Understand whether a problem mentioned in a bad review is widespread**

If you see a bad review come in and want to know whether a holistic solution is required, **use Search**.

1. Having seen a bad review come in, click in the search bar and type "are we seeing issues with \<bad review topic\> in multiple communities?"
2. Based on the results, ask any follow up questions or take action as required
3. You can also navigate to the \*\*community \*\*which received the review and check the \*\*Customers Requiring Attention \*\*tab, then drill down into these and click on the History tab ("I" icon) to understand the full customer journey of each person

## **Stop bad reviews before they happen**

Using the newsfeed, you can see **alerts** as soon as they come in, highlighting complaints and issues customers are facing.

1. Start at \*\*Latest News \*\*(this is the page you will have landed on)
2. Use the\*\*Category filter \*\* to switch off Kudos, Trending and Information so that you are left only with **Alerts**
3. Select the alert then navigate to the community and select the \*\*Customers Requiring Attention \*\*tab
4. Here you'll see those facing issues and you can click on their \*\*email address \*\*to open your mail provider and contact them

## **Know where happy customers are**

Knowing your happy customers can be a powerful tool in your arsenal - if you can identify them, you can encourage them to speak about their good experiences in public.

In the Gateway, you can use Kudos to understand where people are most grateful for the service they've received.

1. Start at **Latest News** (this is the page you will have landed on)
2. Use the **Category filter** to switch off the other alert types and look at only **Kudos**
3. Clicking on one of the alerts will take you to the individual's customer card where you can see their recent experience
4. Click on their **email address** if you wish to contact them
