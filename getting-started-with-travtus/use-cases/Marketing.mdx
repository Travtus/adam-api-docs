## **Problem Statement:**

## **_"I want to understand my customers better"_**

## **<u>Gateway User Journeys</u>**

## **Customer profiling**

**Search** is the best way to get an overarching view of your customers' preferences, views and experiences.

If you are looking to understand what people are **looking for in a particular region**, for example so that you could tailor ads, you can use search to ask "what is the most popular amenity in \<region\>?"

If you want to understand more about **preferences during a particular part of the customer journey**, you could ask "what question comes up most often during onboarding?"

## **Understand where the happiest customers are**

You can use Kudos to understand where people are most grateful for the service they've received.

1. Start at **Latest News** (this is the page you will have landed on)
2. Use the **Category filter** to switch off the other alert types and look at only **Kudos**
3. Clicking on one of the alerts will take you to the individual's customer card where you can see their recent experience
4. Click on their **email address** if you wish to contact them or click on the **community name** (underneath their name) to navigate to the community

## **Understand where the unhappy customers are too**

You can use a similar approach to the above to get a gauge on this.

1. Start at **Latest News** (this is the page you will have landed on)
2. Use the **Category filter** to switch off **Kudos**, **Trending** and **Information** so that you are left only with **Alerts**
3. Select the alert then navigate to the community and select the **Customers Requiring Attention** tab
4. Here you'll see those facing issues and you can click on their **email address** to open your mail provider and contact them, or click on the **community name** (underneath their name) to navigate to the community

## **Suggested searches**

- "What are applicants most concerned about?"
- "What's the most popular amenity in \<region\>?"
- "Where are the happiest customers?"
