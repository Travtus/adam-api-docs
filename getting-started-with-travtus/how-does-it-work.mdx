title: "How does it work?"

## **Listen**

- By connecting to your inboxes and other data sources, we are able to listen to all the "chatter" in your communities.
- We **filter out** any unnecessary data (such as internal emails or emails from your suppliers) and then pass the rest through a series of models.
- This enables us to **identify** things like:
  - residents vs prospects
  - themes in complaints or risks
  - trends in and across communities
- It also feeds our **scoring models** which provide a normalized ranking across all your customers and communities to enable you to identify where to focus. More about that [<u>here</u>](https://docs2.travtus.com/features/home-page/conversational-scores).

## **Respond**

- Our [<u>digital teammate Adam</u>](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9174358-who-is-adam) can respond to your customers on your behalf and act as your **first point of contact**.
  - If **a lot of the contact you get from your customers is Q&A**, e.g. "what is the pet policy", "where is the parking lot", then Adam could be a really useful addition to your team.
  - If you also get **a lot of contact which requires follow-up** such as creating maintenance tasks or sending forms, etc, then the [**<u>automations</u>**](https://help.travtus.com/en/articles/9172791-how-does-it-work#h_5052754249) will be helpful too.
- The way it works is that we **gather the inputs below, enabling us to build a picture of how to help your customers** (residents and prospects alike):
  - Past outbound email responses from your staff from the last 3 months (through the above "Listen" email approach)
  - Company-specific policy documents or guides
  - Community-specific policy documents or guides (such as move in/out process, waste collection process, parking information, etc)
  - Hyperlinks such as to your resident portal or maintenance portal
- Using this wealth of knowledge, Adam is able to respond to your customers' questions. Whenever he **does not feel he has sufficient information to resolve their query, he raises a task for your staff** - this can be in Microsoft ToDo, Dynamics or Salesforce (or in the Gateway itself).

## **Automations**

- As mentioned above, if you get contact from your customers which require actions to be taken, automations can help with this. Examples include:
  - **Creating tasks for your maintenance team**
  - **Registering new tenants**
  - **Notice to vacate**
  - **Renewal reminders**
- These require some information from you on what your current processes are, details for any systems we need to integrate with, etc. [<u>Contact us</u>](mailto:support@travtus.com) if you are interested in getting started with automations.
