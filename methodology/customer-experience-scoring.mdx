**The Customer Experience Score (CES)** is an essential metric for measuring and benchmarking customer sentiment.

The CES scoring system systematically rates and classifies customers based on their level of engagement and satisfaction. This scoring system is crucial to understanding how customers are feeling, which helps to create a positive living atmosphere and boosts customer retention.

## Scoring Methodology

Data is collected by actively observing and updating customer satisfaction levels daily. This ensures a real time, accurate portrayal of customers' feelings and behaviors.

Customers are evaluated on a range from 0-100 based on the following factors:

- Frequency of customer interactions
- The nature and tone of all encounters (i.e. grievances vs. commendations)
- The variety of issues reported by customers
- The persistence of any reported problems
