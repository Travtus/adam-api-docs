title: "Community Scoring"
---

**Community scores** are key to providing comparative evaluations of your properties. Utilizing indicators that examine customer interactions at each property, these scores help you monitor the quality of experiences being delivered.

## Scoring Methodology

Communities are evaluated on a scale of 0-100. Each communityâ€™s performance is normalized based on their size for comparative analysis within your portfolio and industry.

**The Community Score** is calculated by examining customer communications related to:

- Challenges in the **Collections** process
- Volume and nature of **Complaints**
- Number of **Escalations** (due to unresolved issues or matters of high urgency)
- Issues causing **Property Risk**
- Frequency and severity of **Customer Concerns**
- Volume of **Support Requests** (including repeat requests)
- Problems stemming from **Technology** being used

## Benefits

1. Regular scoring supports strategic insights into property operations and customer satisfaction, which are key for customer retention.
2. The scoring framework provides an intuitive understanding of each property's standing, allowing for timely, strategic interventions.
3. Comparisons between properties can help with prioritization and operational decisions, including resource distribution.
4. Property scores set benchmarks for evaluating the impact of changes and initiatives over time.
