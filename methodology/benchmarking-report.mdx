## What is benchmarking?

Benchmarking report allows to compare various communities to the broader industry by using a set of predefined metrics.

The main goal of community benchmarking is to enable organizations to assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of their properties by measuring them against industry-wide performance.

## Methodology

We evaluate each community using the following criteria by using customer request volumes for the past four weeks:

- **Collections**: volume of messages regarding complications with payments.
- **Complaints**: volume of complaints pertaining to property, community, and neighborhood issues or service concerns.
- **Escalations**: volume of messages about the issues that remain unresolved or require attention from the management.
- **Property Risk**: volume of messages highlighting potential risk to health and safety, the condition of the property or to the reputation of the company.
- **People**: number of people with a high volume of messages and high frequency of complaints, escalations, and requests for assistance.
- **Support Requests**: volume of messages, asking for help from the landlord.
- **Technology**: technology and software related issues.

Each metric score is normalized to a scale of 100 units. Using industry-wide dataset we establish the minimum and maximum benchmark scores against which individual community scores are calibrated.

  **Why do we normalize per 100 units?** To enable fair comparisons between communities
  of varying sizes, customer requests are calculated per 100 units. This approach
  ensures that the volume of requests is measured accurately, whether the community
  comprises 500 or 10,000 units.{" "}

**Total community score** is an average of individual metric scores.

Community scores are adjusted on a scale ranging from A+ to C, with A+ representing market leaders and C indicating communities that are trailing.

| Score  | Description                                                                                                                        |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A+** | Achieves **high performance** with fewer volume of metric-related messages than 90% of industry counterparts.                      |
| **A**  | **Moderately high** performance, with volume of messages ranking lower than 65% of their peers, yet not lower than the top 10%.    |
| **B+** | **Moderate** performace with fewer messages than 35% if industry counterparts, yet not lower than 65 % of communities.             |
| **B**  | **Moderately low** performance with the volume of messages ranking lower than 35 % of their peers, yet not higher that bottom 10%. |
| **C**  | **Low** performance when the community lags behind as 90% of industry peers have a lower volume of metric-related messages.        |

## How to read the report?

Benchmarking report is generated every week, using customer requests volume for the past 4 week.

The chart shows how **total community score** (an average of individual metric scores) has changed over time.

Dashed line shows **company median score**, to allow comparison of individual community versus overall company performance.

The benchmarks table displays **scores for specific metrics**. It also includes a summary of customer requests during the week preceding the report's generation date.

Our customer rating system prioritizes the privacy and security of our
clients' data. We employ rigorous measures to ensure that all data used in the
ranking process are anonymized. Each client has access only to their own
rating score. This means that clients cannot view the scores or ranking
positions of other clients.
