## Group
The Travtus system includes the concept of a Group, which is a collection of properties that are operated together/in the same manner.

They share policies, processes, software systems, and sometimes amenities.

Groups can be formed based on location or based on other parameters, and all share a common way of being operated.

Properties in a Group also share responses in the conversational AI interface.

## Landlord
This is used for person records that represent your company or any subsidiary companies or indiviudals that would act as the landlord for a lease.

## External reference
Often referred to as `external_ref` within the API.

Represents a custom identifier for your records that you have the option of setting the value for.

The external reference must only be unique per group and is therefore used in conjunciton with groups in the API.

## Amenity
An attribute associated with listings.

Represents a perk associated with a building, that is available for the buildings residents.

Adding an amenity to a listing implies that potential tenants would be able to benefit from it.

For example:
- Gym access
- Roof Terrace
- Community space

## Feature
An attribute associated with listings.

Represents a feature of the unit associated with the listing.

For example:
- Bathtub/shower
- Double-glazed windows

## Finish
An attribute associated with listings.

Represents the standard of finish for a unit.

This typically indicates the level of comfort associated with the unit and is directly proportional with the rental price of a unit.
