# Connecting data sources

## Overview

Some things worth noting upfront:

- the more data sources you add, the more complete a picture you get of your customers' experience and the goings-on within your communities.
- different feature bundles include different data sources - contact us at [email protected] if you’re unsure what your current bundle includes.

## Benefits

The below table gives you an idea of the benefits of connecting each data source; for further information on each, use the table of contents at the side to navigate through each type.

## Email

Below is the high level process; you can find technical documentation here.

1. Provide us with the following information:
   - Community name
   - Unit count
   - Community email address(es)
2. Grant permissions to our app.
3. Add the required inboxes to a security group or authorize permissions.
4. Adjust access control.
5. And that's it\! The data will start flowing through our models.

<Note>
  - You can also connect **individual staff members'** inboxes. You'll need to let us know when staff leave/join though.
  - It's OK if there are **multiple inboxes per community** (e.g. a separate one for leasing vs maintenance, etc)

## Reviews/Surveys/Other Customer Feedback

### Google Reviews

1. Contact us to let us know you are interested in this data plug
2. Navigate to this URL to authorize access
3. Log in to your Google account (note that the person doing this must have administrative rights)
4. Click Authorize
5. Data will start flowing through our models and contributing to your community scores and summaries.

Note that it's also possible to send this data via csv extracts if you'd prefer (though we would recommend the direct connection to ensure data freshness).

### Surveys

1. Let us know you are interested in this data plug
2. Send us a sample extract from your survey provider
3. We'll send you the URL to an area (Amazon S3 bucket) for you to send files (ideally in csv format), and a key to access the area
4. Agree any frequency, naming convention, etc details with us
5. That's it\! We'll start picking up the files and ingesting the data.

#### 

<Note>
  - Anonymous surveys are still worth sending as long as there is a community identifier (e.g. community name).
</Note>

### Reputation.com

If you use reputation.com and receive the data feed from them, we can ingest this information.

3. We'll send you the URL to an area (Amazon S3 bucket) for you to send files (ideally in csv format), and a key to access the area

  ### General notes on sending csvs

  - No need to send the full list with every extract - a file with changes only (i.e. removals/additions) is fine.
  - If there is no information to send, we recommend sending an empty file with headers only.
