# How does it work?

Travtus operates through three core capabilities that work together to transform your customer experience and operational efficiency.

## Listen

* By connecting to your inboxes and other data sources, we are able to listen to all the "chatter" in your communities.
* We **filter out** any unnecessary data (such as internal emails or emails from your suppliers) and then pass the rest through a series of models.
* This enables us to **identify** things like:
  * residents vs prospects
  * themes in complaints or risks
  * trends in and across communities
* It also feeds our **scoring models** which provide a normalized ranking across all your customers and communities to enable you to identify where to focus. More about that here.

## Respond

* Our digital teammate Adam can respond to your customers on your behalf and act as your **first point of contact**.
  * If **a lot of the contact you get from your customers is Q&A**, e.g. "what is the pet policy", "where is the parking lot", then Adam could be a really useful addition to your team.
  * If you also get **a lot of contact which requires follow-up** such as creating maintenance tasks or sending forms, etc, then the **automations** will be helpful too.
* The way it works is that we **gather the inputs below, enabling us to build a picture of how to help your customers** (residents and prospects alike):
  * Past outbound email responses from your staff from the last 3 months (through the above "Listen" email approach)
  * Company-specific policy documents or guides
  * Community-specific policy documents or guides (such as move in/out process, waste collection process, parking information, etc)
  * Hyperlinks such as to your resident portal or maintenance portal
* Using this wealth of knowledge, Adam is able to respond to your customers' questions. Whenever he **does not feel he has sufficient information to resolve their query, he raises a task for your staff** - this can be in Microsoft ToDo, Dynamics or Salesforce (or in the Gateway itself).

## Automations

* As mentioned above, if you get contact from your customers which require actions to be taken, automations can help with this. Examples include:
  * **Creating tasks for your maintenance team**
  * **Registering new tenants**
  * **Notice to vacate**
  * **Renewal reminders**
* These require some information from you on what your current processes are, details for any systems we need to integrate with, etc. Contact us if you are interested in getting started with automations.
