# Delegating our app access to your Microsoft account

To grant our app access to your Microsoft account, please follow these steps:

1. Provide us with a Microsoft e-mail address associated with the relevant ToDo items.
2. We will set up your user and send you an authentication code via e-mail. Please keep this code safe for further steps. 
<Warning> It is essential that you complete the following steps immediately after receiving the authentication code. The code is set to expire, so if you do not take the necessary steps in a timely manner, we will need to restart the process by generating a new code.</Warning>
3. Navigate to [this link](https://microsoft.com/devicelogin). You will be asked for the authentication code we sent you - please enter it.
