# Connecting Your Google Gmail inbox to the Travtus Platform

Integrating your Gmail inbox with the Travtus platform is a straightforward process. We provide two approaches to
get started, these steps should guide you through successfully delegated authority access for specific Gmail accounts
within your organization.

1. [Domain-wide delegation of authority](#domain-wide-delegation-of-authority)
2. [OAuth 2.0 Authorization](#oauth-2-0-authorization)

## Domain-wide delegation of authority

We recommend using this approach if you use group email addresses as your service inboxes.

To delegate domain-wide authority to our service account:

1. From your domain’s [Admin console](http://admin.google.com/), go to **Main menu ☰ > Security > Access and data control > API controls.**
2. In the **Domain wide delegation** pane, select **Manage Domain Wide Delegation**.
3. Click **Add new**.
4. In the **Client ID** field, enter the client ID that we enclosed in the onboarding email.
5. In the **OAuth Scopes** field, enter a comma-delimited list of the scopes that we provided in the onboarding email.
6. Click **Authorize**.

That's it! Our service account now has domain-wide access to your Gmail inboxes within your organization.

## OAuth 2.0 Authorization

We recommend using this approach if your service inboxes are individual Gmail accounts.

### Step 1: Navigate to Authorization Page

To begin, you need to access the Travtus Gmail authorization page:
    - Ensure you are logged into the Gmail account you wish to integrate, or have access to log in.
    - Navigate to the following URL: [https://google-workspace.travtus.com/gmail/authorize](https://google-workspace.travtus.com/gmail/authorize)

### Step 2: Review and Provide Authorization

Once on the authorization page, you'll need to review and agree to the permissions requested:
    - Carefully read through the Gmail consent screen presented to you.
    - Review the permissions that Travtus is requesting access to.
    - If you agree, click on the button to provide authorization.

### Step 3: Integration complete

After you have approved the access:
    - You will be redirected to the Travtus homepage [https://www.travtus.com/](https://www.travtus.com/).
    - The Travtus platform will automatically handle the integration process.
    - Your Gmail account is now connected to the Travtus platform.

That's it! Your Gmail account will now be accessible through the Travtus platform, providing you with enhanced data management capabilities. For any questions or assistance, please contact our support team at [support@travtus.com](mailto:support@travtus.com).
