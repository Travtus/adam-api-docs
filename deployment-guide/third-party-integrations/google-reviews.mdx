# Connecting Your Google Review Data to the Travtus Platform

Integrating your Google Review data with the Travtus platform is a straightforward process. Follow the steps below to get started:

## Step 1: Provide Admin Email Address
To begin, we need the email address that is an admin of your Google Business Profile. This will allow us to send an invitation to connect your Google Reviews to our platform.
- Ensure the email address you provide has admin privileges for your Google Business Profile.
- Send the admin email address to our support team at [support@travtus.com](mailto:support@travtus.com).

## Step 2: Receive and Accept Invitation
Once we receive your admin email address, we will issue an invitation email. This email will contain a link to approve and provide delegated authority to access the reviews at your communities.
- Check your inbox for the invitation email from Travtus.
- Open the email and click on the provided link: [https://ckkiw6cny5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/live/review/google/authorize](https://ckkiw6cny5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/live/review/google/authorize).
- Follow the instructions on the approval page to grant access.
    
## Step 3: Integration Complete
After you have approved the access, the Travtus platform will automatically handle the community matching and integration process. If you have opted to benefit from the automated review responding feature, no further setup is required. Our system will start managing your review responses immediately.
That's it! Your Google Review data will now be accessible through the Travtus platform, providing you with valuable insights and enhanced data management capabilities.
