title: "Create/Update Persons"
api: "POST https://api.travtus.com/ingestion/persons/multiple/"
description: "This endpoint creates or updates multiple person records passed as a list in the request's body."
---


This API endpoint allows you to create or update multiple person records. The request's body must include a list of person records. The API will attempt to match these records with existing person records within the scope of the portfolio IDs provided in the `Portfolio-IDs` header. If a match is found, the existing person record will be updated with the information you have provided. If no match is found, a new person record will be created and scoped to the portfolios with the IDs you have provided. If no portfolio IDs are provided, the person matching and any newly created person records will be visible company-wide.

Matching of the person records is done in the following order:
  1. By external reference. A person record will be updated if the provided `external_ref` in the request body is an exact match.
  2. By email address (`email_address`) or phone number (`phone_number`).

For a new person record to be successfully created, you must provide either an external reference (`external_ref`) or any combination of phone number (`phone_number`) or email address (`email_address`) AND first name (`first_name`) or (`last_name`). The response will include a list of the persons that have been created or updated, along with their internal identifiers.

For example:
  ```bash Example Request
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.travtus.com/integration/persons/' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: bearer <token>'
    --data-raw '{
        "email_address": "test.user@travtus.com",
        "first_name": "Test"
    }'
  ```
  would be accepted as it provides an email address AND a first name, but
  ```bash Example Request
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.travtus.com/integration/persons/' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: bearer <token>'
    --data-raw '{
        "email_address": "test.user@travtus.com",
        "phone_number": "01234567890"
    }'
  ```
  would not be accepted, as it fails to provide a value for an attribute from the second group (no first or last name provided).
