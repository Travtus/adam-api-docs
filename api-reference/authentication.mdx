Adam API uses token authentication. All API calls must include the following header:
```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <team_token>'

## API Tokens

Please contact _placeholder_ in order for us to create an account for you, specifying an e-mail address you would like to use as an username.

Once we have created your Travtus API account, you will receive an e-mail which will allow you to reset your password.

The API token can be obtained by calling the above endpoint with your username and password.
