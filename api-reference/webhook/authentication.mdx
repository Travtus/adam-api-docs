## Webhook Signature Verification
Webhook signatures are to verify that webhook messages are sent by us. For a more detailed explanation, check out this article on [why you should verify webhooks](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/why).

### How to verify webhooks with Svix Libraries
Our webhook partner Svix offers a set of useful libraries that make verifying webhooks very simple. Here is a an example using Python:


```python
from svix.webhooks import Webhook

secret = "whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw"

# These were all sent from the server
headers = {
  "svix-id": "msg_p5jXN8AQM9LWM0D4loKWxJek",
  "svix-timestamp": "1614265330",
  "svix-signature": "v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE=",
}
payload = '{"test": 2432232314}'

wh = Webhook(secret)
# Throws on error, returns the verified content on success
payload = wh.verify(payload, headers)
```
