When receiving a webhook event, you need to verify the request is coming from us.
In each event we send to you, we include the following headers in the request:

```
{
  "svix-id": "msg_p5jXN8AQM9LWM0D4loKWxJek",
  "svix-timestamp": "1614265330",
  "svix-signature": "v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE=",
}
```

You need to verify the signature on your end. Please follow the instructions to
verify incoming requests.

## Step 1: Install libray

`pip install svix`

## Step 2: Verify signature

```python
from svix.webhooks import Webhook

secret = "whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw"

# These were all sent from the server
headers = {
  "svix-id": "msg_p5jXN8AQM9LWM0D4loKWxJek",
  "svix-timestamp": "1614265330",
  "svix-signature": "v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE=",
}
payload = '{"test": 2432232314}'

wh = Webhook(secret)
# Throws on error, returns the verified content on success
payload = wh.verify(payload, headers)
```

For verifying with other languages, please see this [article](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how)
