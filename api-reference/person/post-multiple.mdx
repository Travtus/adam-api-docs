title: "Create/Update Persons"
api: "POST https://api.travtus.com/persons/multiple/"
description: "This endpoint creates or updates multiple person records passed as a list in the request's body."
---

This API endpoint allows you to create or update multiple person records.

The API will attempt to match these records with existing person records within the scope of the provided groups.

If a match is found, the existing person record will be updated with the information provided.

If no match is found, a new person record will be created and scoped to the provided groups.

If no groups are provided, any updated or created person records will be scoped to all groups.

If you do not have access to one of the groups you have provided, the endpoint will not attempt to match the person record against records in that group and any newly created persons will not be assigned to the group.

Matching of the person records is done in the following order:
  1. By external reference. A person record will be updated if the provided `external_ref` in the request body is an exact match.
  2. By email address (`email_address`) or phone number (`phone_number`).

For a new person record to be successfully created, you must provide either an external reference (`external_ref`) or any combination of phone number (`phone_number`) or email address (`email_address`) AND first name (`first_name`) or (`last_name`).

For example:
  ```bash Example Request
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.travtus.com/integration/persons/' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: bearer <token>'
    --data-raw '{
        "email_address": "test.user@travtus.com",
        "first_name": "Test"
    }'
  ```
would be accepted as it provides an email address AND a first name, but
  ```bash Example Request
    curl --location --request POST 'https://api.travtus.com/integration/persons/' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: bearer <token>'
    --data-raw '{
        "email_address": "test.user@travtus.com",
        "phone_number": "01234567890"
    }'
  ```
would not be accepted, as it fails to provide a value for an attribute from the second group (no first or last name provided).
