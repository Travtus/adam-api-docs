This endpoint allows you to update, create and delete listings for a group.

The endpoint will attempt to reconcile every listing in the request body with an existing one for the given group and update it with the provided details.

If a listing is not found, a new one will be created.

Listings for the provided group that are not included in the request body will be deleted.

If there are no listings passed in the request body, all listings for the provided porfolio will be deleted.

You must provide either a group id via the `group_id` parameter or a group external reference via the `group_external_ref` attribute.
