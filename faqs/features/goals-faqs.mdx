## **Can I track a goal for a specific community?**

Yes! Just click on the goal and use the community filter to select the community you need and then click the pin icon in the top right.

## **How do I smooth out the chart?**

If you can use the granularity filter and select a larger time period (e.g. week instead of day, or month instead of week), you'll see fewer of the peaks/troughs (often caused by weekends).

## **How do I stop tracking a goal?**

Just click the pin again and you'll see it change from black back to grey.

## **What does the trend relate to?**

This shows a comparison to the previous period - and is **dependent on the date filter **you've selected (use the calendar icon in the top right to adjust). If you have selected the last week (the default option) then the trend will compare the past 7 days to the 7 days prior to that; similarly if you've selected the last month then it'll look at the past month and compare to the month before that.
