# **User Management**

## **How do I add a new user?**

Simply [<u>contact us</u>](mailto:support@travtus.com) and let us know the email address, full name, job title and associated communities (if applicable) and we'll do the rest.\

## **How do I reset my password?**

Since we operate with passwordless authentication, you'll never need to do this - simply enter your email address and we'll send you a magic code which is all you need. Check out [<u>this article</u>](https://intercom.help/travtus-d83752c4176c/en/articles/9174494-logging-in-for-the-first-time) for more information on logging in for the first time.

## **Do you do SSO?**

We don't do SSO but our approach to authentication covers a similar use case to that of SSO - since it requires the user's email account to be active in order for them to receive the code and login, when an associate leaves the organisation, they will no longer have the ability to login.

**Inbox Management**

## **How do I connect a new community inbox?**

As above, [**<u>contact us</u>**](mailto:support@travtus.com) and let us know. If it's a **new community**, we'll need the community name, email address, unit count and address. If you just need to update (or add to) the inbox for an **existing community**, we just need to know the community name and new email address (and you'll need to make sure it's added to the security group on your side - click here for more information on that).

## **Can I connect staff inboxes or does it have to be general community inboxes?**

Yes - if you don't have general community inboxes then staff inboxes are fine too.

## **Is it OK to have multiple email addresses per community?**

Yes! If you have a setup where there are, for example, different email addresses for leasing vs maintenance vs management for each community, that's absolutely fine.

# **Extension management**

## **Why is my Outlook add-on greyed out?**

The Outlook add-on only becomes active when you have clicked on an email. If you select an email in the reading pane, you should see the icon darken.\

**Can I use the Gateway in Microsoft Edge?**

Great news! If you are a Microsoft Edge user rather than a Chrome user, you can now use the Gateway where you feel most comfortable. Simply follow the steps below.

1. In Microsoft Edge, use the three dots in the top right to select **Extensions **and then click **Manage Extensions **in the pop-up that appears.
2. Select **Select Allow extensions from other stores **at the bottom of the panel on the left:

   <img
     src="/images/edgeextensions1.png"
     alt="Edgeextensions1 Pn"
     title="Edgeextensions1 Pn"
     className="mx-auto"
     style={{ width:"28%" }}
   />


3. Scroll to the bottom of the page and you'll see a note offering to take you to the **Chrome web store (underneath the Microsoft Edge store button) **- click this link:

   <img
     src="/images/edgeextension2.png"
     alt="Edgeextension2 Pn"
     title="Edgeextension2 Pn"
     style={{ width:"81%" }}
   />
4. In the **search box, type "travtus" **or "travtus gateway" and you should see the Gateway extension appear - click "Get". And that's it! From here you should be able to log in and start getting insights.

## **Why does the Outlook link send me to a confirmation page about the web version?**

This is Microsoft-specific behaviour and shouldn't affect your experience - you should still see the extension in your Outlook app.

## **Why has my extension disappeared from Chrome?**

Chrome may have disabled the extension requiring you to re-approve the permissions that the extension needs. If you go to the 3 dots in the top right of your browser, then Extensions, Manage Extensions, you'll be taken to a page where you can re-enable it.

<img
  src="/images/extensionschromegone.png"
  alt="Extensionschromegone Pn"
  title="Extensionschromegone Pn"
  style={{ width:"47%" }}
/>

Find the Travtus Gateway tile and ensure the toggle in the bottom right is "on" (blue) - if it's not, click it to switch it back on, and if prompted, click "Re-enable".
