## **Why am I seeing data like "1234567"?**

If our models identify something in the data as being sensitive or personal, e.g. a credit card number, driving license or passport number, medical data, etc then we obfuscate the data.

## **Why does a low-scoring community not have any customers requiring attention?**

It's worth noting that: the community scoring and customer experience scoring are two separate models, and that the "customers requiring attention" relates to the date filter you have selected. The most likely cause of this scenario is that your filter is currently set to the last _week_, during which there were no high priority customers, whereas the community score takes into account events from the last _90 days_.

## **Messages: Why do the numbers on the Queue tab not add up to the total messages?**

This tab is designed to give you an overview of the types of things people are contacting about, in order to inform staffing decisions. Thus the numbers on this tab are restricted by messages from customers only.
