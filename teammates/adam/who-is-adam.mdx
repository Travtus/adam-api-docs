title: "Who is Adam?"
---

Adam is your digital teammate; he can play many roles within your organization but primarily he helps by being the**first point of contact**  for your customers.

Stuff he can help with:

- **fielding questions** from residents and prospects, such as "what is your policy on pets?", "how do I apply for a parking permit?"
- taking next steps on questions they are asking, such as:
  - **sending them the appropriate form** if a resident asks "how do I add a new tenant?"
  - giving them a **link to the maintenance portal **for the community if the resident says anything our models identify as requiring support of this nature, such as "my washing machine is broken", "there's a leak in my kitchen", etc
  - sending them to the right place on the website if a prospect wants to **book a tour**
- **creating tasks** for your teams if next steps are required - this could include maintenance tasks or tasks to deal with complaint escalations, inspections, etc
