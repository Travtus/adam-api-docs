```

Include JS library 
```
<script src="https://uat-adam3-chat.travtus.com/v2/index.js"></script>
```

Initialize Adam Chat widget by calling 
```
AdamChat.init(‘adam-bot’,options)
```

Make sure that in the options, you include the clientId and source 

e.g. 
```
AdamChat.init(‘adam-bot’,{clientId: ‘01234567’, source: ‘website’})

## Widget API 
The below describe the options and moethods that can be called in the Widget API to customize behaviour of the chat widget. 

### Methods
The below methods can be called:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="init()">
Creates the Adam Chat icon in the bottom, right corner of the page. It initializes the frame necessary to show/hide the adam chat widget. 

It takes two parameters: 

The ID of the HTML element where the widget will be loaded.
```
AdamChat.init(‘elementId’, ‘options’)
```

An object of options to allow for widget customization behaviour AND to send the mandatory clientId and source.
```
AdamChat.init(‘adam-bot’, {clientId: ‘testClientId’, source:'website'})
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="remove()">
Destroys the chat completely, removing it from the bottom of the page. It will remove all chat related HTML. Therefore, in order to add the chat again, you must initialize it using Init() 
```
AdamChat.remove()
```
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="openChatWindow()">
Acts like a click on the Adam Chat icon, opening the chat window. This can be used especially for mobile, where you might not want the chat icon to show up, rather having a button click on a custom element where you initialize the widget and force open the chat.  
```
AdamChat.openChatWindow()
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="closeChatWindow()">
Acts like a click on the close icon on the top right hand corner of the open widget.
