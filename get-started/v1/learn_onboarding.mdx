## Connect the Adam O365 App (ADAM3-LEARN)
Authorize the Adam application to be able to access Email address within the domain. 

To do this navigate [HERE](https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/adminconsent?client_id=a130724b-da41-4556-8d63-1abb61c196d1) to grant permissions to the application. You will need to login as an Authorized user. 

After successful granting of permissions, you should be redirected to the success page on hiadam.com.  


## Configure Active Directory Security Settings
Create a Security Group to restrict the inboxes that the Adam application is able to monitor.

### Create Security Group
- Login to portal.office365.com with an Admin account
- Click [HERE](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/groups) and click on the tab[Mail-enabled security]
- Click on **Add a group**
- Select **Mail-enabled security** then click Next
- Set a Group Name e.g. “Adam Email App Security Group” name and click Next
- Set a group Email Address 
- Allow access to external users  **Communication**
- Select **Approval** (this requires owner approval to be able to join the group)
- Click Next, then create.

_Make note of the Group Email address - you will need this later._

### Add Email Inboxes to Group
Add the inboxes to be monitored to the security group that you have just made. 

Click [HERE](https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/#/groups) and click on tab **Mail-enabled security**
Click on the group and add emails you want to allow APIs to access


### Access Restriction Policy
Restrict the permissions that the security group is able to access. 

- Run PowerShell as Admin
- Run 
	```
	Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned\
	```
- Install required Utilities 

	```
	Install-Module PowerShellGet -Force (skip if already installed)
	```

	```
	Install-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement -Force (skip if already installed)
	```

	```
	Get-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement (skip if already installed)
	```

- Login as ADMIN to create Restriction Policy:

	```
	Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName {ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE}
	```
- Sign in as Admin in pop-up window and run

	```
	New-ApplicationAccessPolicy -AppId a130724b-da41-4556-8d63-1abb61c196d1 -PolicyScopeGroupId {GROUP_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE} -AccessRight RestrictAccess -Description "YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE."
	```

### Test if the Access Restriction is working:
To test a specific inbox address has been added to the security group correctly, run the below command in powershell.

	```
	Test-ApplicationAccessPolicy -Identity {AN_EMAIL_ADDRESS_HERE} -AppId a130724b-da41-4556-8d63-1abb61c196d1
	```
**AccessCheckResult** should be _**Granted**_ or _**Denied**_
