## Widget Installation

<Warning>The chat widget must be embedded in an environment accessible through the public Internet.</Warning>

Include the installation script before the `</body>` tag on every page you want Adam to show, replacing `CLIENT_ID` with the relevant community ID:

```
<script src="https://adam-widget.travtus.com/main.js"></script>
<script>
  (function () {
    window.onload = function () {
      AdamChat.init('adam-bot', {
        clientId: "CLIENT_ID",
        source: "website"
      });                
    }
  })()
</script>
```

## Widget API 
The below describe the options and methods that can be called in the Widget API to customize behaviour of the chat widget. 

### Methods

The below methods can be called:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="init(reference, options)">
Initializes Adam, and returns the instance.

It takes two arguments: 

`reference`: A unique reference for the instance (use `adam` if unsure):

```
AdamChat.init("adam", options);
```

`options`: An options object to configure the widget (`clientId` and `source` are mandatory):

```
AdamChat.init("adam", {
  clientId: "CLIENT_ID",
  source: "website"
});
```

You can find more options to customize the widget below.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="remove()">
Disconnects the chat and removes it from the page:

```
AdamChat.remove();
```

In order to initialize the chat again, you must use the init() method detailed above.
</Accordion>


<Accordion title="openChatWindow()">
Acts like a click on the Adam launcher, opening the chat window. This can be especially useful for mobile, where you might not want the launcher button to show - rather you can create a custom element and trigger the opening of the chat window programatically:

```
AdamChat.openChatWindow();
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="closeChatWindow()">
Closes the chat window:

```
AdamChat.closeChatWindow();
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


### Available Options
These values enable you to tailor the widget to your requirements.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="clientId">
`string`

This is a _mandatory_ field. Pass the clientId relating to your community.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="source">
`string`

This is a _mandatory_ field. Pass one of the following values to identify the channel that the conversations is being held on:

    - **portal** - if the user is accessing Adam via a private/secure portal
    - **website** - if the user is accessing Adam via a public website
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="clientInfo">
`object`

You can optionally pass a `clientInfo` object to initiate the chat with the user information pre-loaded (e.g. for use in resident portals in logged-in state):
	
	- **firstName** `string`: user's first name
  - **lastName** `string`: user's last name
  - **phoneNumber** `string`: user's registered phone number
  - **email** `string`: user's registered email address
  - **unit** `string`: apartment number
  - **address** `string`: property address
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="colors">
`object`

You can optionally pass a `colors` object to tailor the colors used in the widget to your brand:
	
	- **background** `string`: 6-digit HEX or RGB string
  - **foreground** `string`: 6-digit HEX or RGB string
  - **text** `string`: user's 6-digit HEX or RGB string

When passing a `colors` object, the icon on the launcher button will change from the Travtus T logo to a message bubble.

Hide the "Powered by Travtus" footer. Defaults to `false`.
</Accordion>
