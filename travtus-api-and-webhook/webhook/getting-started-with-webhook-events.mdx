# Using Travtus Webhooks

Webhooks allow services to notify each other of events. They work by sending a `POST` request to a pre-determined endpoint. Below are the details on how to set up, verify, and manage Travtus webhooks effectively.

## Introduction to Travtus Webhooks

At their core, webhooks are a way to send automated messages or information from one app to another as events happen. For example, you can set up an endpoint like `https://www.example.com/acme/webhooks/` to receive notifications from Travtus.

To indicate that a webhook has been processed, return a `2xx` (status code `200-299`) response to the webhook message within a reasonable time frame (15 seconds). Disable `CSRF` protection for this endpoint if the framework you use enables it by default.

### Why Verify Webhooks

Webhook signatures help verify that the messages are genuinely sent by Travtus and not by an attacker. Signatures also help prevent replay attacks by including a timestamp in the webhook. Itâ€™s crucial to verify the signature and timestamp to ensure the security of your application.

For more details on the importance of verifying webhooks, refer to [why you should verify webhooks](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/why).

## How to Verify Webhooks with Travtus Libraries

Travtus uses Svix libraries to make webhook verification simple. Below is an example using Python:

### Python Example

```python
from svix.webhooks import Webhook

secret = "whsec_MfKQ9r8GKYqrTwjUPD8ILPZIo2LaLaSw"

# These were all sent from the server
headers = {
  "svix-id": "msg_p5jXN8AQM9LWM0D4loKWxJek",
  "svix-timestamp": "1614265330",
  "svix-signature": "v1,g0hM9SsE+OTPJTGt/tmIKtSyZlE3uFJELVlNIOLJ1OE=",
}
payload = '{"test": 2432232314}'

wh = Webhook(secret)
# Throws on error, returns the verified content on success
payload = wh.verify(payload, headers)
```

For more instructions and examples on how to verify signatures, check out the [webhook verification documentation](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how).

## Adding an Endpoint

To start receiving messages from Travtus, you need to configure your **endpoints**:

1. **Access the Webhook Portal**: Request a short-lived URL for accessing your webhook consumer application portal.
2. **Add Endpoint**: Provide a URL and a list of **event types** you want to listen to.

> **Helpful Tip!** If you don't have a URL or your service isn't ready to start receiving events, press the **use Svix Play** button for a temporary URL.

If you don't specify any event types, your endpoint will receive all events by default. This can be helpful for initial testing.

### Testing Your Endpoint

Use the "Testing" tab to send example events to your endpoint.

After sending an example event, click into the message to view the payload, message attempts, and success or failure status.

## Retries

Travtus uses a retry schedule with exponential backoff for delivering webhook messages.

### Retry Schedule

Each message is retried based on the following schedule:

- Immediately
- 5 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 2 hours
- 5 hours
- 10 hours
- 10 hours (repeated)

If an endpoint fails consistently for 5 days, it will be disabled, and an `EndpointDisabledEvent` will be sent.

### Manual Retries

You can manually retry each message or automatically retry all failed messages from a specific date using the application portal.

## Troubleshooting Tips

### Common Issues

1. **Not Using the Raw Payload Body**: Verify the payload exactly as sent to ensure accurate verification.
2. **Missing the Secret Key**: Ensure you are using the correct secret key unique to each endpoint.
3. **Wrong Response Codes**: Use the correct response status codes to indicate success or failure.
4. **Responses Timing Out**: Ensure your endpoint responds within 15 seconds. Consider processing messages asynchronously to avoid timeouts.

## Failure Recovery

### Re-enable a Disabled Endpoint

To re-enable a disabled endpoint, go to the webhook dashboard, find the endpoint, and select "Enable Endpoint".

### Recovering/Resending Failed Messages

If you need to replay a single event, find the message from the UI, click the options menu, and select "resend". For more extensive recovery, use the "Recover Failed Messages" option.
